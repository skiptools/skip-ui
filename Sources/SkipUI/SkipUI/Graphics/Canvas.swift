/// A view type that supports immediate mode drawing.
///
/// Use a canvas to draw rich and dynamic 2D graphics inside a SkipUI view.
/// The canvas passes a ``GraphicsContext`` to the closure that you use
/// to perform immediate mode drawing operations. The canvas also passes a
///  value
/// that you can use to customize what you draw. For example, you can use the
/// context's ``GraphicsContext/stroke(_:with:lineWidth:)`` command to draw
/// a ``Path`` instance:
///
///     Canvas { context, size in
///         context.stroke(
///             Path(ellipseIn: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: size)),
///             with: .color(.green),
///             lineWidth: 4)
///     }
///     .frame(width: 300, height: 200)
///     .border(Color.blue)
///
/// The example above draws the outline of an ellipse that exactly inscribes
/// a canvas with a blue border:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a canvas view that shows the green outline of an
/// ellipse inside a blue rectangle.](Canvas-1)
///
/// In addition to outlined and filled paths, you can draw images, text, and
/// complete SkipUI views. To draw views, use the
/// ``init(opaque:colorMode:rendersAsynchronously:renderer:symbols:)`` method
/// to supply views that you can reference from inside the renderer. You can
/// also add masks, apply filters, perform transforms, control blending, and
/// more. For information about how to draw, see ``GraphicsContext``.
///
/// A canvas doesn't offer interactivity or accessibility for
/// individual elements, including for views that you pass in as symbols.
/// However, it might provide better performance for a complex drawing that
/// involves dynamic data. Use a canvas to improve performance for a drawing
/// that doesn't primarily involve text or require interactive elements.
