/// A background material type.
///
/// You can apply a blur effect to a view that appears behind another view by
/// adding a material with the ``View/background(_:ignoresSafeAreaEdges:)``
/// modifier:
///
///     ZStack {
///         Color.teal
///         Label("Flag", systemImage: "flag.fill")
///             .padding()
///             .background(.regularMaterial)
///     }
///
/// In the example above, the ``ZStack`` layers a ``Label`` on top of the color
/// ``ShapeStyle/teal``. The background modifier inserts the
/// regular material below the label, blurring the part of
/// the background that the label --- including its padding --- covers:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a label on a teal background, where the area behind
/// the label appears blurred.](Material-1)
///
/// A material isn't a view, but adding a material is like inserting a
/// translucent layer between the modified view and its background:
///
/// ![An illustration that shows a background layer below a material layer,
/// which in turn appears below a foreground layer.](Material-2)
///
/// The blurring effect provided by the material isn't simple opacity. Instead,
/// it uses a platform-specific blending that produces an effect that resembles
/// heavily frosted glass. You can see this more easily with a complex
/// background, like an image:
///
///     ZStack {
///         Image("chili_peppers")
///             .resizable()
///             .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
///         Label("Flag", systemImage: "flag.fill")
///             .padding()
///             .background(.regularMaterial)
///     }
///
/// ![A screenshot of a label on an image background, where the area behind
/// the label appears blurred.](Material-3)
///
/// For physical materials, the degree to which the background colors pass
/// through depends on the thickness. The effect also varies with light and
/// dark appearance:
///
/// ![An array of labels on a teal background. The first column, labeled light
/// appearance, shows a succession of labels on blurred backgrounds where the
/// blur increases from top to bottom, resulting in lighter and lighter blur.
/// The second column, labeled dark appearance, shows a similar succession of
/// labels, except that the blur gets darker from top to bottom. The rows are
/// labeled, from top to bottom: no material, ultra thin, thin, regular, thick,
/// and ultra thick.](Material-4)
///
/// If you need a material to have a particular shape, you can use the
/// ``View/background(_:in:fillStyle:)-20tq5`` modifier. For example, you can
/// create a material with rounded corners:
///
///     ZStack {
///         Color.teal
///         Label("Flag", systemImage: "flag.fill")
///             .padding()
///             .background(.regularMaterial, in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8))
///     }
///
/// ![A screenshot of a label on a teal background, where the area behind
/// the label appears blurred. The blurred area has rounded corners.](Material-5)
///
/// When you add a material, foreground elements exhibit vibrancy,
/// a context-specific blend of the foreground and background colors
/// that improves contrast. However using ``View/foregroundStyle(_:)``
/// to set a custom foreground style --- excluding the hierarchical
/// styles, like ``ShapeStyle/secondary`` --- disables vibrancy.
///
/// > Note: A material blurs a background that's part of your app, but not
/// what appears behind your app on the screen.
/// For example, the content on the Home Screen doesn't affect the appearance
/// of a widget.
