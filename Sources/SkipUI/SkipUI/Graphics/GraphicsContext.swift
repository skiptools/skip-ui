/// An immediate mode drawing destination, and its current state.
///
/// Use a context to execute 2D drawing primitives. For example, you can draw
/// filled shapes using the ``fill(_:with:style:)`` method inside a ``Canvas``
/// view:
///
///     Canvas { context, size in
///         context.fill(
///             Path(ellipseIn: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: size)),
///             with: .color(.green))
///     }
///     .frame(width: 300, height: 200)
///
/// The example above draws an ellipse that just fits inside a canvas that's
/// constrained to 300 points wide and 200 points tall:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a view that shows a green ellipse.](GraphicsContext-1)
///
/// In addition to outlining or filling paths, you can draw images, text,
/// and SkipUI views. You can also use the context to perform many common
/// graphical operations, like adding masks, applying filters and
/// transforms, and setting a blend mode. For example you can add
/// a mask using the ``clip(to:style:options:)`` method:
///
///     let halfSize = size.applying(CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 0.5, y: 0.5))
///     context.clip(to: Path(CGRect(origin: .zero, size: halfSize)))
///     context.fill(
///         Path(ellipseIn: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: size)),
///         with: .color(.green))
///
/// The rectangular mask hides all but one quadrant of the ellipse:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a view that shows the upper left quarter of a green
/// ellipse.](GraphicsContext-2)
///
/// The order of operations matters. Changes that you make to the state of
/// the context, like adding a mask or a filter, apply to later
/// drawing operations. If you reverse the fill and clip operations in
/// the example above, so that the fill comes first, the mask doesn't
/// affect the ellipse.
///
/// Each context references a particular layer in a tree of transparency layers,
/// and also contains a full copy of the drawing state. You can modify the
/// state of one context without affecting the state of any other, even if
/// they refer to the same layer. For example you can draw the masked ellipse
/// from the previous example into a copy of the main context, and then add a
/// rectangle into the main context:
///
///     // Create a copy of the context to draw a clipped ellipse.
///     var maskedContext = context
///     let halfSize = size.applying(CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 0.5, y: 0.5))
///     maskedContext.clip(to: Path(CGRect(origin: .zero, size: halfSize)))
///     maskedContext.fill(
///         Path(ellipseIn: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: size)),
///         with: .color(.green))
///
///     // Go back to the original context to draw the rectangle.
///     let origin = CGPoint(x: size.width / 4, y: size.height / 4)
///     context.fill(
///         Path(CGRect(origin: origin, size: halfSize)),
///         with: .color(.blue))
///
/// The mask doesn't clip the rectangle because the mask isn't part of the
/// main context. However, both contexts draw into the same view because
/// you created one context as a copy of the other:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a view that shows the upper left quarter of a green
/// ellipse, overlaid by a blue rectangle centered in the
/// view.](GraphicsContext-3)
///
/// The context has access to an ``EnvironmentValues`` instance called
/// ``environment`` that's initially copied from the environment of its
/// enclosing view. SkipUI uses environment values --- like the display
/// resolution and color scheme --- to resolve types like ``Image`` and
/// ``Color`` that appear in the context. You can also access values stored
