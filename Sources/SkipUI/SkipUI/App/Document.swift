/// app can open when you declare your app using the ``App`` protocol.
///
/// Initialize a document group scene by passing in the document model and a
/// view capable of displaying the document type. The document types you supply
/// to `DocumentGroup` must conform to ``FileDocument`` or
/// ``ReferenceFileDocument``. SkipUI uses the model to add document support
/// to your app. In macOS this includes document-based menu support, including
/// the ability to open multiple documents. On iOS this includes a document
/// browser that can navigate to the documents stored on the file system
/// and multiwindow support:
///
///     @main
///     struct MyApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             DocumentGroup(newDocument: TextFile()) { configuration in
///                 ContentView(document: configuration.$document)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// Any time the configuration changes, SkipUI updates the contents
/// with that new configuration, similar to other parameterized builders.
///
/// ### Viewing documents
///
/// If your app only needs to display but not modify a specific
/// document type, you can use the file viewer document group scene. You
/// supply the file type of the document, and a view that displays the
/// document type that you provide:
///
///     @main
///     struct MyApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             DocumentGroup(viewing: MyImageFormatDocument.self) {
///                 MyImageFormatViewer(image: $0.document)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Supporting multiple document types
///
/// Your app can support multiple document types by adding additional
/// document group scenes:
///
///     @main
///     struct MyApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             DocumentGroup(newDocument: TextFile()) { group in
///                 ContentView(document: group.$document)
///             }
///             DocumentGroup(viewing: MyImageFormatDocument.self) { group in
///                 MyImageFormatViewer(image: group.document)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// ### Accessing the document's URL
///
/// If your app needs to know the document's URL, you can read it from the `editor`
/// closure's `configuration` parameter, along with the binding to the document.
/// When you create a new document, the configuration's `fileURL` property is `nil`.
/// Every time it changes, it is passed over to the `DocumentGroup` builder
/// in the updated `configuration`.
/// This ensures that the view you define in the closure always knows
/// the URL of the document it hosts.
///
///     @main
///     struct MyApp: App {
///         var body: some Scene {
///             DocumentGroup(newDocument: TextFile()) { configuration in
///                 ContentView(
///                     document: configuration.$document,
///                     fileURL: configuration.fileURL
///                 )
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// The URL can be used, for example, to present the file path of the file name
/// in the user interface.
/// Don't access the document's contents or metadata using the URL because that
/// can conflict with the management of the file that SkipUI performs.
/// Instead, use the methods that ``FileDocument`` and ``ReferenceFileDocument``
/// provide to perform read and write operations.
