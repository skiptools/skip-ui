/// A type that you use to create custom alignment guides.
///
/// Every built-in alignment guide that ``VerticalAlignment`` or
/// ``HorizontalAlignment`` defines as a static property, like
/// ``VerticalAlignment/top`` or ``HorizontalAlignment/leading``, has a
/// unique alignment identifier type that produces the default offset for
/// that guide. To create a custom alignment guide, define your own alignment
/// identifier as a type that conforms to the `AlignmentID` protocol, and
/// implement the required ``AlignmentID/defaultValue(in:)`` method:
///
///     private struct FirstThirdAlignment: AlignmentID {
///         static func defaultValue(in context: ViewDimensions) -> CGFloat {
///             context.height / 3
///         }
///     }
///
/// When implementing the method, calculate the guide's default offset
/// from the view's origin. If it's helpful, you can use information from the
/// ``ViewDimensions`` input in the calculation. This parameter provides context
/// about the specific view that's using the guide. The above example creates an
/// identifier called `FirstThirdAlignment` and calculates a default value
/// that's one-third of the height of the aligned view.
///
/// Use the identifier's type to create a static property in an extension of
/// one of the alignment guide types, like ``VerticalAlignment``:
///
///     extension VerticalAlignment {
///         static let firstThird = VerticalAlignment(FirstThirdAlignment.self)
///     }
///
/// You can apply your custom guide like any of the built-in guides. For
/// example, you can use an ``HStack`` to align its views at one-third
/// of their height using the guide defined above:
///
///     struct StripesGroup: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             HStack(alignment: .firstThird, spacing: 1) {
///                 HorizontalStripes().frame(height: 60)
///                 HorizontalStripes().frame(height: 120)
///                 HorizontalStripes().frame(height: 90)
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
///     struct HorizontalStripes: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             VStack(spacing: 1) {
///                 ForEach(0..<3) { _ in Color.blue }
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// Because each set of stripes has three equal, vertically stacked
/// rectangles, they align at the bottom edge of the top rectangle. This
/// corresponds in each case to a third of the overall height, as
/// measured from the origin at the top of each set of stripes:
///
/// ![Three vertical stacks of rectangles, arranged in a row.
/// The rectangles in each stack have the same height as each other, but
/// different heights than the rectangles in the other stacks. The bottom edges
/// of the top-most rectangle in each stack are aligned with each
/// other.](AlignmentId-1-iOS)
///
/// You can also use the ``View/alignmentGuide(_:computeValue:)-6y3u2`` view
/// modifier to alter the behavior of your custom guide for a view, as you
/// might alter a built-in guide. For example, you can change
/// one of the stacks of stripes from the previous example to align its
/// `firstThird` guide at two thirds of the height instead:
///
///     struct StripesGroupModified: View {
///         var body: some View {
///             HStack(alignment: .firstThird, spacing: 1) {
///                 HorizontalStripes().frame(height: 60)
///                 HorizontalStripes().frame(height: 120)
///                 HorizontalStripes().frame(height: 90)
///                     .alignmentGuide(.firstThird) { context in
///                         2 * context.height / 3
///                     }
///             }
///         }
///     }
///
/// The modified guide calculation causes the affected view to place the
/// bottom edge of its middle rectangle on the `firstThird` guide, which aligns
/// with the bottom edge of the top rectangle in the other two groups:
///
/// ![Three vertical stacks of rectangles, arranged in a row.
/// The rectangles in each stack have the same height as each other, but
/// different heights than the rectangles in the other stacks. The bottom edges
/// of the top-most rectangle in the first two stacks are aligned with each
/// other, and with the bottom edge of the middle rectangle in the third
/// stack.](AlignmentId-2-iOS)
