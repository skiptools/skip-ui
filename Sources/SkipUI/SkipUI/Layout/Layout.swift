/// A type that defines the geometry of a collection of views.
///
/// You traditionally arrange views in your app's user interface using built-in
/// layout containers like ``HStack`` and ``Grid``. If you need more complex
/// layout behavior, you can define a custom layout container by creating a type
/// that conforms to the `Layout` protocol and implementing its required
/// methods:
///
/// * ``Layout/sizeThatFits(proposal:subviews:cache:)``
///   reports the size of the composite layout view.
/// * ``Layout/placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)``
///   assigns positions to the container's subviews.
///
/// You can define a basic layout type with only these two methods:
///
///     struct BasicVStack: Layout {
///         func sizeThatFits(
///             proposal: ProposedViewSize,
///             subviews: Subviews,
///             cache: inout ()
///         ) -> CGSize {
///             // Calculate and return the size of the layout container.
///         }
///
///         func placeSubviews(
///             in bounds: CGRect,
///             proposal: ProposedViewSize,
///             subviews: Subviews,
///             cache: inout ()
///         ) {
///             // Tell each subview where to appear.
///         }
///     }
///
/// Use your layout the same way you use a built-in layout
/// container, by providing a ``ViewBuilder`` with the list of subviews
/// to arrange:
///
///     BasicVStack {
///         Text("A Subview")
///         Text("Another Subview")
///     }
///
/// ### Support additional behaviors
///
/// You can optionally implement other protocol methods and properties to
/// provide more layout container features:
///
/// * Define explicit horizontal and vertical layout guides for the container by
///   implementing ``explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:)-8ofeu``
///   and ``explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:)-3iqmu``,
///   respectively.
/// * Establish the preferred spacing around the container by implementing
///   ``spacing(subviews:cache:)-86z2e``.
/// * Indicate the axis of orientation for a container that has characteristics
///   of a stack by implementing the ``layoutProperties-5rb5b`` static property.
/// * Create and manage a cache to store computed values across different
///   layout protocol calls by implementing ``makeCache(subviews:)-23agy``.
///
/// The protocol provides default implementations for these symbols
/// if you don't implement them. See each method or property for details.
///
/// ### Add input parameters
///
/// You can define parameters as inputs to the layout, like you might
/// for a ``View``:
///
///     struct BasicVStack: Layout {
///         var alignment: HorizontalAlignment
///
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// Set the parameters at the point where you instantiate the layout:
///
///     BasicVStack(alignment: .leading) {
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// If the layout provides default values for its parameters, you can omit the
/// parameters at the call site, but you might need to keep the parentheses
/// after the name of the layout, depending on how you specify the defaults.
/// For example, suppose you set a default alignment for the basic stack in
/// the parameter declaration:
///
///     struct BasicVStack: Layout {
///         var alignment: HorizontalAlignment = .center
///
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// To instantiate this layout using the default center alignment, you don't
/// have to specify the alignment value, but you do need to add empty
/// parentheses:
///
///     BasicVStack() {
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// The Swift compiler requires the parentheses in this case because of how the
/// layout protocol implements this call site syntax. Specifically, the layout's
/// ``callAsFunction(_:)`` method looks for an initializer with exactly zero
/// input arguments when you omit the parentheses from the call site.
/// You can enable the simpler call site for a layout that doesn't have an
/// implicit initializer of this type by explicitly defining one:
///
///     init() {
///         self.alignment = .center
///     }
///
/// For information about Swift initializers, see
/// [Initialization](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Initialization.html)
/// in *The Swift Programming Language*.
///
/// ### Interact with subviews through their proxies
///
/// To perform layout, you need information about all of its subviews, which
/// are the views that your container arranges. While your layout can't
/// interact directly with its subviews, it can access a set of subview proxies
/// through the ``Subviews`` collection that each protocol method receives as
/// an input parameter. That type is an alias for the ``LayoutSubviews``
/// collection type, which in turn contains ``LayoutSubview`` instances
/// that are the subview proxies.
///
/// You can get information about each subview from its proxy, like its
/// dimensions and spacing preferences. This enables
/// you to measure subviews before you commit to placing them. You also
/// assign a position to each subview by calling its proxy's
/// ``LayoutSubview/place(at:anchor:proposal:)`` method.
/// Call the method on each subview from within your implementation of the
/// layout's ``placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)`` method.
///
/// ### Access layout values
///
/// Views have layout values that you set with view modifiers.
/// Layout containers can choose to condition their behavior accordingly.
/// For example, a built-in ``HStack`` allocates space to its subviews based
/// in part on the priorities that you set with the ``View/layoutPriority(_:)``
/// view modifier. Your layout container accesses this value for a subview by
/// reading the proxy's ``LayoutSubview/priority`` property.
///
/// You can also create custom layout values by creating a layout key.
/// Set a value on a view with the ``View/layoutValue(key:value:)`` view
/// modifier. Read the corresponding value from the subview's proxy using the
/// key as an index on the subview. For more information about creating,
/// setting, and accessing custom layout values, see ``LayoutValueKey``.

    /// Creates and initializes a cache for a layout instance.
    ///
    /// You can optionally use a cache to preserve calculated values across
    /// calls to a layout container's methods. Many layout types don't need
    /// a cache, because SkipUI automatically reuses both the results of
    /// calls into the layout and the values that the layout reads from its
    /// subviews. Rely on the protocol's default implementation of this method
    /// if you don't need a cache.
    ///
    /// However you might find a cache useful when:
    ///
    /// - The layout container repeats complex, intermediate calculations
    /// across calls like ``sizeThatFits(proposal:subviews:cache:)``,
    /// ``placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)``, and
    /// ``explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:)-8ofeu``.
    /// You might be able to improve performance by calculating values
    /// once and storing them in a cache.
    /// - The layout container reads many ``LayoutValueKey`` values from
    /// subviews. It might be more efficient to do that once and store the
    /// results in the cache, rather than rereading the subviews' values before
    /// each layout call.
    /// - You want to maintain working storage, like temporary Swift arrays,
    /// across calls into the layout, to minimize the number of allocation
    /// events.
    ///
    /// Only implement a cache if profiling shows that it improves performance.
    ///
    /// ### Initialize a cache
    ///
    /// Implement the `makeCache(subviews:)` method to create a cache.
    /// You can add computed values to the cache right away, using information
    /// from the `subviews` input parameter, or you can do that later. The
    /// methods of the ``Layout`` protocol that can access the cache
    /// take the cache as an in-out parameter, which enables you to modify
    /// the cache anywhere that you can read it.
    ///
    /// You can use any storage type that makes sense for your layout
    /// algorithm, but be sure that you only store data that you derive
    /// from the layout and its subviews (lazily, if possible). For this to
    /// work correctly, SkipUI needs to be able to call this method to
    /// recreate the cache without changing the layout result.
    ///
    /// When you return a cache from this method, you implicitly define a type
    /// for your cache. Be sure to either make the type of the `cache`
    /// parameters on your other ``Layout`` protocol methods match, or use
    /// a type alias to define the ``Cache`` associated type.
    ///
    /// ### Update the cache
    ///
    /// If the layout container or any of its subviews change, SkipUI
    /// calls the ``updateCache(_:subviews:)-9hkj9`` method so you can
    /// modify or invalidate the contents of the
    /// cache. The default implementation of that method calls the
    /// `makeCache(subviews:)` method to recreate the cache, but you can
    /// provide your own implementation of the update method to take an
    /// incremental approach, if appropriate.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - subviews: A collection of proxy instances that represent the
    ///     views that the container arranges. You can use the proxies in the
    ///     collection to get information about the subviews as you
    ///     calculate values to store in the cache.
    ///
    /// - Returns: Storage for calculated data that you share among
    ///   the methods of your custom layout container.
    func makeCache(subviews: Self.Subviews) -> Self.Cache

    /// Updates the layout's cache when something changes.
    ///
    /// If your custom layout container creates a cache by implementing the
    /// ``makeCache(subviews:)-23agy`` method, SkipUI calls the update method
    /// when your layout or its subviews change, giving you an opportunity
    /// to modify or invalidate the contents of the cache.

    /// use the spacing preferences of the subview edges that make
    /// contact with the container's edges:
    ///
    ///     extension BasicVStack {
    ///         func spacing(subviews: Subviews, cache: inout ()) -> ViewSpacing {
    ///             var spacing = ViewSpacing()

    ///             for index in subviews.indices {
    ///                 var edges: Edge.Set = [.leading, .trailing]
    ///                 if index == 0 { edges.formUnion(.top) }

    ///     }
    ///
    /// In the above example, the first and last subviews contribute to the

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - subviews: A collection of proxy instances that represent the
    ///     views that the container arranges. You can use the proxies in the
    ///     collection to get information about the subviews as you determine

    /// * The ``ProposedViewSize/zero`` proposal; respond with the

    ///             }
    ///         }
    ///
    ///         // This layout also needs a placeSubviews() implementation.
    ///     }
    ///
    /// The implementation asks each subview for its ideal size by calling the
    /// ``LayoutSubview/sizeThatFits(_:)`` method with an
    /// ``ProposedViewSize/unspecified`` proposed size.
    /// It then reduces these values into a single size that represents
    /// the maximum subview width and the sum of subview heights.
    /// Because this example isn't flexible, it ignores its size proposal
    /// input and always returns the same value for a given set of subviews.
    ///
    /// SkipUI views choose their own size, so the layout engine always
    /// uses a value that you return from this method as the actual size of the
    /// composite view. That size factors into the construction of the `bounds`
    /// input to the ``placeSubviews(in:proposal:subviews:cache:)`` method.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - proposal: A size proposal for the container. The container's parent
    ///     view that calls this method might call the method more than once
    ///     with different proposals to learn more about the container's
    ///     flexibility before deciding which proposal to use for placement.
    ///   - subviews: A collection of proxies that represent the
    ///     views that the container arranges. You can use the proxies in the
    ///     collection to get information about the subviews as you determine
    ///     how much space the container needs to display them.
    ///   - cache: Optional storage for calculated data that you can share among
    ///     the methods of your custom layout container. See
    ///     ``makeCache(subviews:)-23agy`` for details.
    ///
    /// - Returns: A size that indicates how much space the container
    ///   needs to arrange its subviews.
    func sizeThatFits(proposal: ProposedViewSize, subviews: Self.Subviews, cache: inout Self.Cache) -> CGSize

    /// Assigns positions to each of the layout's subviews.
    ///
    /// SkipUI calls your implementation of this method to tell your

    /// The example creates a placement point that starts at the origin of the
    /// specified `bounds` input and uses that to place the first subview. It
    /// then moves the point in the y dimension by the subview's height,

    /// subview operations use an ``ProposedViewSize/unspecified`` size
    /// proposal to indicate that subviews should use and report their ideal
    /// size.
    ///
    /// A more complex layout container might add space between subviews
    /// according to their ``LayoutSubview/spacing`` preferences, or a
    /// fixed space based on input configuration. For example, you can extend
    /// the basic vertical stack's placement method to calculate the
    /// preferred distances between adjacent subviews and store the results in
    /// an array:
    ///
    ///     let spacing: [CGFloat] = subviews.indices.dropLast().map { index in
    ///         subviews[index].spacing.distance(
    ///             to: subviews[index + 1].spacing,
    ///             along: .vertical)
    ///     }
    ///
    /// The spacing's ``ViewSpacing/distance(to:along:)`` method considers the
    /// preferences of adjacent views on the edge where they meet. It returns
    /// the smallest distance that satisfies both views' preferences for the
    /// given edge. For example, if one view prefers at least `2` points on its
    /// bottom edge, and the next view prefers at least `8` points on its top
    /// edge, the distance method returns `8`, because that's the smallest
    /// value that satisfies both preferences.
    ///
    /// Update the placement calculations to use the spacing values:

    ///     var point = bounds.origin
    ///     for (index, subview) in subviews.enumerated() {

    /// parameters on your other ``Layout`` protocol methods match, or use
    /// a type alias to define the ``Cache`` associated type.
    ///

    ///
    /// If the layout container or any of its subviews change, SkipUI
    /// calls the ``updateCache(_:subviews:)-9hkj9`` method so you can

///             let flexibilities = subviews.map { subview in
///                 subview[Flexibility.self]
///             }

///             // Calculate and return the size of the layout container.
///             // ...
