///
/// Five generic type constraints define a specific `OutlineGroup` instance:
///
/// - `Data`: The type of a collection containing the children of an element in
///   the tree-shaped data.
/// - `ID`: The type of the identifier for an element.
/// - `Parent`: The type of the visual representation of an element whose
///   children property is non-`nil`
/// - `Leaf`: The type of the visual representation of an element whose
///   children property is `nil`.
/// - `Subgroup`: A type of a view that groups a parent view and a view
///   representing its children, typically with some mechanism for showing and
///   hiding the children
