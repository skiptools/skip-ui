/// A container view that arranges other views in a two dimensional layout.
///
/// Create a two dimensional layout by initializing a `Grid` with a collection
/// of ``GridRow`` structures. The first view in each grid row appears in
/// the grid's first column, the second view in the second column, and so
/// on. The following example creates a grid with two rows and two columns:
///
///     Grid {
///         GridRow {
///             Text("Hello")
///             Image(systemName: "globe")
///         }
///         GridRow {
///             Image(systemName: "hand.wave")
///             Text("World")
///         }
///     }
///
/// A grid and its rows behave something like a collection of ``HStack``
/// instances wrapped in a ``VStack``. However, the grid handles row and column
/// creation as a single operation, which applies alignment and spacing to
/// cells, rather than first to rows and then to a column of unrelated rows.
/// The grid produced by the example above demonstrates this:
///
/// ![A screenshot of items arranged in a grid. The upper-left
/// position in the grid contains the word hello. The upper-right contains
/// an image of a globe. The lower-left contains an image of a waving hand.
/// The lower-right contains the word world. The cells of the grid
/// have minimal vertical or horizontal spacing.](Grid-1-iOS)
///
/// > Note: If you need a grid that conforms to the ``Layout``
/// protocol, like when you want to create a conditional layout using
/// ``AnyLayout``, use ``GridLayout`` instead.
///
/// ### Multicolumn cells
///
/// If you provide a view rather than a ``GridRow`` as an element in the
/// grid's content, the grid uses the view to create a row that spans all of
/// the grid's columns. For example, you can add a ``Divider`` between the
/// rows of the previous example:
///
///     Grid {
///         GridRow {
///             Text("Hello")
///             Image(systemName: "globe")
///         }
///         Divider()
///         GridRow {
///             Image(systemName: "hand.wave")
///             Text("World")
///         }
///     }
///
/// Because a divider takes as much horizontal space as its parent offers, the
/// entire grid widens to fill the width offered by its parent view.
///
/// ![A screenshot of items arranged in a grid. The upper-left
/// cell in the grid contains the word hello. The upper right contains
/// an image of a globe. The lower-left contains an image of a waving hand.
/// The lower-right contains the word world. A dividing line that spans
/// the width of the grid separates the upper and lower elements. The grid's
/// rows have minimal vertical spacing, but it's columns have a lot of
/// horizontal spacing, with column content centered horizontally.](Grid-2-iOS)
///
/// To prevent a flexible view from taking more space on a given axis than the
/// other cells in a row or column require, add the
/// ``View/gridCellUnsizedAxes(_:)`` view modifier to the view:
///
///     Divider()
///         .gridCellUnsizedAxes(.horizontal)
///
/// This restores the grid to the width that the text and images require:
///
/// ![A screenshot of items arranged in a grid. The upper-left
/// position in the grid contains the word hello. The upper-right contains
/// an image of a globe. The lower-left contains an image of a waving hand.
/// The lower-right contains the word world. A dividing line that spans
/// the width of the grid separates the upper and lower elements. The grid's
/// rows and columns have minimal vertical or horizontal spacing.](Grid-3-iOS)
///
/// To make a cell span a specific number of columns rather than the whole
/// grid, use the ``View/gridCellColumns(_:)`` modifier on a view that's
/// contained inside a ``GridRow``.
///
/// ### Column count
///
/// The grid's column count grows to handle the row with the largest number of
/// columns. If you create rows with different numbers of columns, the grid
/// adds empty cells to the trailing edge of rows that have fewer columns.
/// The example below creates three rows with different column counts:
///
///     Grid {
///         GridRow {
///             Text("Row 1")
///             ForEach(0..<2) { _ in Color.red }
///         }
///         GridRow {
///             Text("Row 2")
///             ForEach(0..<5) { _ in Color.green }
///         }
///         GridRow {
///             Text("Row 3")
///             ForEach(0..<4) { _ in Color.blue }
///         }
///     }
///
/// The resulting grid has as many columns as the widest row, adding empty
/// cells to rows that don't specify enough views:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a grid with three rows and six columns. The first
/// column contains cells with the labels Row 1, Row 2, and Row 3, reading
/// from top to bottom. The text is centered in the cell in each case. The
/// other columns contain cells that are either filled with a rectangle, or
/// that are empty. Scanning from left to right, the first row contains two
/// red rectangle cells after its label cell, and then three empty cells.
/// The second row contains five green rectangle cells after its label cell.
/// The third row contains four blue rectangle cells after its label cell,
/// and then one empty cell. There's 20 points of space between each of
/// the cells.](Grid-4-iOS)
///
/// The grid sets the width of all the cells in a column to match the needs of
/// column's widest cell. In the example above, the width of the first column
/// depends on the width of the widest ``Text`` view that the column contains.
/// The other columns, which contain flexible ``Color`` views, share the
/// remaining horizontal space offered by the grid's parent view equally.
///
/// Similarly, the tallest cell in a row sets the height of the entire row.
/// The cells in the first column of the grid above need only the height
/// required for each string, but the ``Color`` cells expand to equally share
/// the total height available to the grid. As a result, the color cells
/// determine the row heights.
///
/// ### Cell spacing and alignment
///
/// You can control the spacing between cells in both the horizontal and
/// vertical dimensions and set a default alignment for the content in all
/// the grid cells when you initialize the grid using the
/// ``init(alignment:horizontalSpacing:verticalSpacing:content:)`` initializer.
/// Consider a modified version of the previous example:
///
///     Grid(alignment: .bottom, horizontalSpacing: 1, verticalSpacing: 1) {
///         // ...
///     }
///
/// This configuration causes all of the cells to use ``Alignment/bottom``
/// alignment --- which only affects the text cells because the colors fill
/// their cells completely --- and it reduces the spacing between cells:
///
/// ![A screenshot of a grid with three rows and six columns. The first
/// column contains cells with the labels Row 1, Row 2, and Row 3, reading
/// from top to bottom. The text is horizontally centered and bottom aligned
/// in the cell in each case. The other columns contain cells that are either
/// filled with a rectangle, or that are empty. Scanning from left to right,
/// the first row contains two red rectangle cells after its label cell, and
/// then three empty cells. The second row contains five green rectangle cells
/// after its label cell. The third row contains four blue rectangle cells
/// after its label cell, and then one empty cell. There's 1 point of space
/// between each of the cells.](Grid-5-iOS)
///
/// You can override the alignment of specific cells or groups of cells. For
/// example, you can change the horizontal alignment of the cells in a column
/// by adding the ``View/gridColumnAlignment(_:)`` modifier, or the vertical
/// alignment of the cells in a row by configuring the row's
/// ``GridRow/init(alignment:content:)`` initializer. You can also align
/// a single cell with the ``View/gridCellAnchor(_:)`` modifier.
///
/// ### Performance considerations
///
/// A grid can size its rows and columns correctly because
/// it renders all of its child views immediately. If your app exhibits
/// poor performance when it first displays a large grid that appears
/// inside a ``ScrollView``, consider switching to a ``LazyVGrid`` or
/// ``LazyHGrid`` instead.
///
/// Lazy grids render their cells when SkipUI needs to display
/// them, rather than all at once. This reduces the initial cost of displaying
/// a large scrollable grid that's never fully visible, but also reduces the
/// grid's ability to optimally lay out cells. Switch to a lazy grid only if
/// profiling your code shows a worthwhile performance improvement.

    ///     var point = bounds.origin
    ///     for (index, subview) in subviews.enumerated() {

    /// If you use the ``View/gridCellColumns(_:)`` modifier to cause
    /// a cell to span more than one column, or if you place a view in a grid
    /// outside of a row so that the view spans the entire grid, the grid
    /// automatically converts its vertical and horizontal alignment guides
    /// to the unit point equivalent for the merged cell, and uses an
    /// anchor-based approach for that cell. For example, the following grid
    /// places the marker at the center of the merged cell by converting the
    /// grid's default ``Alignment/center`` alignment guide to a
    /// ``UnitPoint/center`` anchor for the blue marker in the merged cell:
    ///
    ///     Grid(alignment: .center, horizontalSpacing: 1, verticalSpacing: 1) {
    ///         GridRow {
    ///             Color.red.frame(width: 60, height: 60)
    ///             Color.red.frame(width: 60, height: 60)
    ///             Color.red.frame(width: 60, height: 60)
    ///         }
    ///         GridRow {
    ///             Color.red.frame(width: 60, height: 60)
    ///             Color.blue.frame(width: 10, height: 10)
    ///                 .gridCellColumns(2)
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// The grid makes this conversion in part to avoid ambiguity. Each column
    /// has its own horizontal guide, and it isn't clear which of these
    /// a cell that spans multiple columns should align with. Further, in
    /// the example above, neither of the center alignment guides for the
    /// second or third column would provide the expected behavior, which is
    /// to center the marker in the merged cell. Anchor alignment provides
